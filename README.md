# Piano-Sequencer
Type in a song and let the magic unfold!  
## ATTENTION:
A new linux port has been made, available in the Linux branch, based on version 1.2.1 beta.
### Python Modules Used:
winsound (Works only on windows), os, sys, time
### How to use: 
To type one note, type the note followed by the time period. Use '!' or '^' to play lower or a higher octave respectively.  
Use Capital letters for sharp notes (Flat keys are NOT used in this sequencer).  
Separate each note by a space.  
Example: c4 c!4 C1 c^2.  
Here, c4 is a 4-beat C major note in the middle octave, c!4 is a 4 beat C major note in the lower octave.
### Saving and running songs in the sequencer:
You can also save and run songs directly using the sequencer. Enter the bpm and type in the song like you normally would to play it. Enter a name for it and it is now saved.
To run a song, simply type in the name of the song you used to save it.
##### Note:
The files are saved in .txt format in "%USERPROFILE%\Piano_Sequencer". Just paste the path in the search box or the run dialog box.
